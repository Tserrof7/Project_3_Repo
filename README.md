Steam Games & Revenue Analysis

Project Overview:
	In this project we have chosen to use two datasets, one containing information about the games on the Steam store, and the other containing revenue information about the top 1500 games on the Steam store. These datasets were already available and made using the free to use API provided by Steam. Ultimately, our goal was to explore the data and see what we could find out with the information provided. We made several graphs/charts to answer questions such as what genres of games are being played most, what are the top developers based on average user score, and what games are performing best based on revenue. 


Script Instructions:
	The script for this project was built using the python library Dash. Dash is built on Python, Javascript, HTML, and Flask. Dash allows users to create visually appealing dashboards in a manner that doesn’t require extensive knowledge of Flask, HTML, or JS. To view the dashboard, simply use the terminal to navigate to where the python script is located and then run the script. From there the webpage will open and show the dashboard, it’s tabs, and the graphs contained within each tab. Some graphs are interactive, having either a dropdown menu or radio buttons. To change the values shown in these graphs, either select a different value from the dropdown menu or select a different radio button.

Ethical Considerations:
	A large reason for choosing to work with data from the Steam store is that it is free to use from the Steam API provided by Steam itself. With this in mind, we can rest assured knowing that our data is ethically sourced since it is provided by Steam and we are not looking for any sort of private information. All the data sourced from the Steam API is publicly available to anyone who chooses to use it.
